# HackerRank Bash Final Challenge

### Trees and ASCII Art 

* Final Challenge in HackerRank Bash Practice series

* HackerRank.com 
* Practice, Compete, Find Jobs
* The HackerRank Community is the largest learning and competition community for programmers

Problem:

* Draw an ASCII art tree in the form of a "Y".
* The first "Y" has a base of 16 char and a top of 16 char
* For the second iteration, start the base at the 2 tops of the previous "Y" 
* but each new "Y" is 1/2 as tall and wide. Eg. 8 char, 4 char, 2 char... 1
* Repeat this for up to 5 interations.
* The output is on a 63 x 100 grid and uses underscores (_) and one (1) characters 

Useage: echo "3" | bash ascii-tree-art.sh 

* Input: values between 1 and 5, via the echo command 

Note: 

* Although "bash" has come along way since the early days of Bourne Shell this 
example shows why another languange choice like Python might have been better.
